Key Terms

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a theoretical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. Narrow AI describes the systems we use today, which are designed to perform specific tasks, such as generating text or identifying images, using Machine Learning (ML), a method where algorithms improve their performance by identifying patterns in vast datasets.

Write/Prompt

Popular media often frames artificial intelligence through the lens of sentient beings or existential threats, a narrative tradition that stems from our historical fascination with creating life and the subsequent "Frankenstein complex" or fear of the creator being replaced by the creation. This focus on AGI often distorts the public’s understanding of the technology by suggesting that software possesses a "mind" or "intent," when in reality, modern systems operate on complex statistical probabilities. For this discussion, please identify a specific depiction of AI from a film, novel, or television show and contrast its behavior with a real-world Narrow AI application we have explored in this module. Discuss how the fictional portrayal might lead to specific public misconceptions regarding the current capabilities, limitations, or ethical risks of actual algorithmic tools.

Respond/Reply

After sharing your initial analysis, engage with at least two of your classmates by comparing their chosen fictional examples to your own. In your responses, consider whether the fictional depiction they selected helps or hinders the public's digital literacy. You might suggest a different real-world technology that shares a surprising similarity with their fictional example or challenge the idea that the fictional trope is entirely unrealistic given current developmental trends in machine learning.

Evaluation/Rubric

Your grade will be determined by your ability to clearly differentiate between cinematic tropes and the technical reality of Narrow AI. High-quality posts will correctly apply at least one key term and provide a nuanced critique of the cultural narrative. Peer responses must go beyond simple agreement, offering substantive insights or posing critical questions that further the collective understanding of how we perceive technology versus how it actually functions.
